{"language": "en", "text": " One of the things he writes about that's very moving is how much your support meant to him and how much it made him more capable as a leader and as an activist to know that you were with him, that you agreed with him, that you already agreed with him before he'd ever had a chance to talk to you about it. He talks about it very movingly when he's been poisoned with a nerve agent. He's nearly three weeks in a coma in Germany. He's very nearly kill him. And he writes movingly about how your presence was a neurobiological miracle. It was the only thing that brought him back. And the thing that I thought about that, preparing to talk to you today, is that in many ways you've stepped into his shoes. You're the leader of the Russian opposition because he can't be anymore. But who can be that role for you? Who can support you the way that he supported him?"}
