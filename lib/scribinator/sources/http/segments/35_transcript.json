{"language": "en", "text": " I don't want to blame anyone for this. Because it's letting her put in who killed my husband, nobody else. But if to take a look at the past, I think that all the governments, democratic governments, will blame this putting for many years the kind of game. Trying to negotiate with him, seeking connections with him, waiting probably that one day he will become one of them, a kind of normal. But the one thing which they didn't notice and which we must remember that putting always life. And I think that government and officials, governments and officials, they just missed this moment. So putting was trying here by year to move these borders and to he was doing awful things more and more awful and everybody was sitting and waiting. Probably the next day he will stop. But we need to remember that he never stopped and of course it was mistake that all this pressure on putting has started just after the war. The war in Ukraine has started."}
