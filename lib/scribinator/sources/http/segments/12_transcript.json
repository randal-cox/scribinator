{"language": "en", "text": " When he writes in the book about sort of spontaneously saying to a crowd of people that has assembled when he's been arrested, he's in trouble with the law, and nobody knows what's going to happen to him. And he seems to sort of, he writes how he sort of surprised himself by saying, don't be afraid of anything. He writes about it as if that kind of burst out of him. And he was happy that it burst out of him. It's something that he'd been feeling, but he hadn't articulated that way. I think people in this country, certainly people around the world, indelibly think of him with that sentiment, not only because we know what ultimately happened to him, because long before they killed him, we knew what they were doing to him. And for him to not be afraid himself, but to tell other people, this is the secret. This is the way out of repression. This is the way to beat a dictator, is to not be afraid of him. Do you know where he learned that? I mean, it seems like you believe it, too. Did the two of you come up with it?"}
