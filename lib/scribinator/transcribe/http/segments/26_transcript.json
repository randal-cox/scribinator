And since the Ukraine war has served as a pretext to increasingly ratchet up the punishment for dissent in Russia, I feel like even on that time frame, the repression right now of independent media dissent political opposition in Russia is cranked down tighter than I've ever seen it in the last 25 years, that the repression, in particular, of the media just feels total. And so while the Anti-Corruption Foundation continues during its work, while the opposition continues during its work, while you still try to find ways for people to express their resistance to the Putin regime, looking from the outside, I don't see how you do it, because I don't see that anybody has any space to operate without putting themselves in grave danger. And it just seems like there are so few people who have the kind of superhuman courage and bravery that your husband represented. How do you work in that repressive and environment?"}
