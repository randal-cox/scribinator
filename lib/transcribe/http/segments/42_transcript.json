{"language": "en", "text": " Last question for you. It means, I think it means a lot to the world that Patriot, a memoir, Alexe's prison diaries, but also his memory, excuse me, but also his memoir are out now. It's a remarkable book. As I said, I did not intend to read all of it. I did not have time. You really messed me up. Sorry. That's OK. But it took a lot to get this out into the world. A lot of risk and a lot of effort. And it is a remarkable document. What do you want people to take away from this? What do you think is the most important thing for people to know about this book?"}
