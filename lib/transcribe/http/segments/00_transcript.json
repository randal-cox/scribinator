{"language": "en", "text": " Yulia Navalnya is a Russian opposition leader. She is the wife now, the widow of Alexei Navalny. Navalny's secret prison diaries and his memoir are somehow miraculously being published this week. The book is called Patriot, a memoir. I read every word of the book. I could not put it down. Yulia Navalnya, it is a real honor to have you here. Thank you."}
