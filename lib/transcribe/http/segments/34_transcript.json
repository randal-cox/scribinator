And I feel not necessarily guilty, but frustrated and angry that we haven't been able to do more to stop Putin from doing what he's done to the Russian people and now to the Ukrainian people and beyond. What could America do that we haven't done? What could America do to support effective opposition to his regime? What could America do more? What else could America have done to prevent the murder of your husband?"}
