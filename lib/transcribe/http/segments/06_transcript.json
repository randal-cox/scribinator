{"language": "en", "text": " Thank you. I will tell you, we're in the midst of a very heated election system season in this country, as you know. And my confession to you is that I did not intend to read all of the book. I thought, I am not going to have time. I'm really busy. I'm going to read the beginning. And the end, have other people read it and tell me what's about. I read every word of it. I couldn't stop reading it. I found it incredibly moving. Thank you. Can you tell me a little bit about what it took to get the book into print? I imagine that you had to have a hand in editing the manuscript. I imagine there may have been some hard decisions for you in terms of things that felt personal, that you might have want to keep between you and your husband that you never the less put in the book. What was it like to bring it to fruition?"}
