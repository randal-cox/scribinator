{"language": "en", "text": " How could I not believe Alexei's sacrifice all his life for this? And I feel like I must continue his work. I feel like I must continue what he did for many, many years. It's very important for me. And I believe that all these changes, they very often happen in one day. It doesn't mean that we need to sit down and chair and to wait them one day to another day. Of course, we need to do something. But it doesn't mean that we need to expect from people to do everyday huge things. Just to do everything, everyday something small, to encourage people, to motivate people, to show them that we are all together, to get this regime against war, against Putin especially. And we are together in this aim. It's very important. So, absolutely, I believe. And I don't promise you that it happened tomorrow. And we know that it could take years. I absolutely understand it. But for mothers, how to live, if not to believe, in good changes."}
