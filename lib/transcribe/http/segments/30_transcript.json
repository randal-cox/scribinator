{"language": "en", "text": " Alexei writes in the book that when the regime started arresting him and imprisoning him, he says they had two aims. And the first was to hurt his ability to work. He says when you're in prison, it's hard to get your work done. And even when you're under house arrest, it's hard to get your work done. And when he was obviously a very committed candidate for office, I found it very moving that he wrote about not wanting to be a protest or symbolic candidate. He wanted to be a candidate who would win. He believed in democracy and wanted to make people's votes really count for something. So to stop his work, the other reason for arresting him and charging him with the things they charged him with was to undercut his message. He's obviously an anti-corruption crusader, so they would charge him with things that would make him seem like, oh, he's the corrupt one as well. It seems to me though that the other reason that they were, there's a third aim in arresting him and imprisoning him, which is to break down other people's will, to make an example of him so that he, what happened to him would scare other people. Especially after what has happened to him and what has happened to the media and what has happened to the opposition and what has happened with Russia during the Ukraine war, which has made everything worse. Do you still believe that the collapse of the regime is inevitable and that Russia will be democratic one day?"}
